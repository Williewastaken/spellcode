Getting Started
Installation

    Prerequisites:
        Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python website.

    Download SpellCode Interpreter:
        Clone the SpellCode repository from GitHub:

        bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spellcode.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

        cd spellcode

    External Modules (Optional):
        To utilize external modules, create .spell files in the same directory as spellcode.py. For example, create Charms.spell for additional incantations.

Running SpellCode Scripts

    Create a SpellCode Script:
        Write your SpellCode code in a .spell file or directly within the main function in spellcode.py.

    Execute the Script:
        Open your terminal or command prompt.
        Navigate to the directory containing spellcode.py.
        Run the interpreter using:

        bash

        python3 spellcode.py

    Using External Modules:
        Ensure your external .spell modules are in the same directory.
        Use the Import statement within your SpellCode script to include them.

Language Overview
Basic Syntax

SpellCode combines elements from traditional programming languages with magical terminology. Here's an overview of its basic syntax:

    Comments: Use // for single-line comments.

    spellcode

    // This is a comment

    Statements: Each statement ends with a semicolon ;.

    Blocks: Use curly braces {} to define blocks of code.

Basic Syntax Diagram

Diagram: Basic Syntax Structure in SpellCode
Variable Declarations

Variables in SpellCode are referred to as Wands. Declaring a wand involves specifying its type, name, and initial value.

Syntax:

spellcode

Wand <variable_name> = <value>;

Example:

spellcode

Wand spellCount = 5;
Wand wizardName = "Harry Potter";

Data Types

SpellCode supports the following primary data types:

    Integers: Whole numbers.

    spellcode

Wand count = 10;

Strings: Text enclosed in double quotes.

spellcode

Wand greeting = "Hello, Wizard!";

Lists: Ordered collections enclosed in square brackets.

spellcode

    Wand ingredients = ["Unicorn Hair", "Dragon Scale", "Phoenix Feather"];

    Booleans: True or False values.

Operators

SpellCode includes standard arithmetic and comparison operators:

    Arithmetic Operators:
        Addition: +
        Subtraction: -
        Multiplication: *
        Division: /

    Comparison Operators:
        Equal to: ==
        Not equal to: !=
        Less than: <
        Less than or equal to: <=
        Greater than: >
        Greater than or equal to: >=

Example:

spellcode

Wand total = spellCount + 10;
If (total > 15) {
    Print("You've mastered advanced spells!");
}

Control Structures
Conditional Statements

SpellCode uses If and Else for conditional branching.

Syntax:

spellcode

If (<condition>) {
    // Code to execute if condition is True
} Else {
    // Code to execute if condition is False
}

Example:

spellcode

If (spellCount > 5) {
    Print("You're a skilled wizard!");
} Else {
    Print("Keep practicing your spells.");
}

Conditional Statements Diagram

Diagram: Conditional Statements Flow in SpellCode
Loops

SpellCode supports For and While loops for repetitive tasks.
For Loop

Iterates over each element in a list.

Syntax:

spellcode

For each (Type variable in iterable) {
    // Code to execute for each element
}

Example:

spellcode

Wand ingredients = ["Unicorn Hair", "Dragon Scale", "Phoenix Feather"];
For each (Ingredient ingredient in ingredients) {
    Print("Adding:", ingredient);
}

While Loop

Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is True.

Syntax:

spellcode

While (<condition>) {
    // Code to execute while condition is True
}

Example:

spellcode

Wand attempts = 0;
While (attempts < 3) {
    Print("Attempting spell...");
    attempts = attempts + 1;
}

Loops Diagram

Diagram: Loop Structures in SpellCode
Functions (Incantations)

In SpellCode, functions are referred to as Incantations. They allow you to encapsulate reusable code blocks.
Defining Incantations

Syntax:

spellcode

Incantation "<name>" (<parameters>) {
    // Body of the incantation
}

    <name>: Name of the incantation (enclosed in double quotes).
    <parameters>: Comma-separated list of parameters with their types.

Example:

spellcode

Incantation "Lumos" () {
    Print("Light shines from the wand.");
}

Calling Incantations

Once defined, you can invoke an incantation by its name followed by parentheses.

Syntax:

spellcode

<Incantation_Name>();

Example:

spellcode

Lumos();

Incantations with Parameters:

spellcode

Incantation "Transfigure" (Object obj, String form) {
    Print(obj, "has been transfigured into", form + ".");
}

Transfigure("Broom", "Phoenix Feather Broom");

Incantations Diagram

Diagram: Incantations (Functions) in SpellCode
Modules and Imports

SpellCode allows you to organize code into modules and reuse code across different scripts using the Import statement.
Importing Modules

Syntax:

spellcode

Import "<Module_Name>";

    <Module_Name>: Name of the module file without the .spell extension (enclosed in double quotes).

Example:

spellcode

Import "Defense";
Import "Transfiguration";

Built-in Libraries

SpellCode comes with built-in libraries that provide a set of predefined incantations. These libraries can be imported and used within your scripts.

Creating External Modules

To organize your code better and reuse functionalities, you can create external modules.
a. Create an External Module

    Create Charms.spell:
        In the same directory as spellcode.py, create a file named Charms.spell.
    Content of Charms.spell:

    spellcode

    // Charms.spell

    Incantation "Wingardium Leviosa" () {
        Print("The object is now levitating!");
    }

b. Use the External Module in Your Main Script

    Modify the Main Script:
        Update the code string within the main() function to include the import and usage of the external module.

    spellcode

Import "Defense";
Import "Transfiguration";
Import "Charms";

Wand spellCount = 5;
Wand increment = 2;
Wand total = spellCount + increment * 3;

Print("Total Spells:", total);

Incantation "Lumos" () {
    Print("Light shines from the wand.");
}

Incantation "Expelliarmus" () {
    Print("Disarming spell cast!");
}

Lumos();
Expelliarmus();

Wand ingredients = ["Unicorn Hair", "Dragon Scale", "Phoenix Feather"];
Wand count = 0;

For each (Ingredient ingredient in ingredients) {
    Print("Adding:", ingredient);
    count = count + 1;
}

Print("Total Ingredients Added:", count);

Wand condition = 0;

While (condition < 3) {
    Print("Condition is less than 3");
    condition = condition + 1;
}

Protego();
Expelliarmus();
Transfigure("Broom", "Phoenix Feather Broom");
Wingardium Leviosa();

Run the Interpreter:

bash

python3 spellcode.py

Expected Output:

vbnet

    Built-in Module "Defense" imported successfully.
    Built-in Module "Transfiguration" imported successfully.
    Built-in Module "Charms" imported successfully.
    Wand Declared: spellCount = 5

    Wand Declared: ingredients = ['Unicorn Hair', 'Dragon Scale', 'Phoenix Feather']
    Wand Declared: count = 0
    For Loop: ingredient = Unicorn Hair
    Print: Adding: Unicorn Hair
    Wand Assigned: count = 1
    For Loop: ingredient = Dragon Scale
    Print: Adding: Dragon Scale
    Wand Assigned: count = 2
    For Loop: ingredient = Phoenix Feather
    Print: Adding: Phoenix Feather
    Wand Assigned: count = 3
    Print: Total Ingredients Added: 3
    Wand Declared: condition = 0
    While Loop: Condition is True
    Print: Condition is less than 3
    Wand Assigned: condition = 1
    While Loop: Condition is True
    Print: Condition is less than 3
    Wand Assigned: condition = 2
    While Loop: Condition is True
    Print: Condition is less than 3
    Wand Assigned: condition = 3
    Protego! Shielding against dark forces.
    Expelliarmus! Disarming the opponent.
    Broom has been transfigured into Phoenix Feather Broom.
    The object is now levitating!
